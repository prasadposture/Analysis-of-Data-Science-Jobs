As John Naisbitt once said, \"We are drowning in information but starving for knowledge.\" But to conquer this, there has been a rapid development in the field of data science. This field makes use of mainly statistics, mathematics, scientific methods, computer programming, machine learning, deep learning and many more things to extract knowledge, generate insights and derive patterns from the noisy, unstrutured data. The growth of this field has brought many job opportunites across the world, due to this, the data science has become the most sought after career option today. This field will continue to grow, since the need of analayzing the mammoth  amount of data is increasing day-by-day. There are various job titles among this field and to understand about them, here I have data of 3755 job titles from the companies all across the world. I will perform question based analysis to generate various insights and to see what are the main factors that affect the relation of job titles and their salaries. If you find this notebook useful please upvote and if you have any sugesstions or queries please feel free to contact me. Thank you."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e9624e7a","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.009142,"end_time":"2023-05-27T18:19:24.103868","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-05-27T18:19:24.094726","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["#
